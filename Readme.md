# Second Website in pure HTML and CSS
---
## Description 
The second project of the assignment of INeuron is made for the restaurant business in pure HTML and CSS. The overall time took to complete this project was around `3-4 hours`. The effort in this project was for navbar and the image positioning including multiple button positioning. We need to add background image to the entire webpage that should not only be in scale but also with less transperancy so that the menu items, navbar and all other elements should be visible on top of that background image.
